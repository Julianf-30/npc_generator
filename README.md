NPC Generator
Julian Fechner

## Highlights
Hello! This is an npc generator I created for all of your npc needs! It generates npcs for you with random attributes. You may choose how many you would like to generate as well, but it must be over 10.

## Overview

My name is Julian and I made this generator for roleplay/openworld games. The attributes that will be generated with the npc's are specifically designed for those kinds of games. The attributes that come with the npc's are:
    -Names
    -Gender
    -Style
    -Age
    -Race
As you can see, those are the kinds of attributes that differentiate the npc's in openworld games. 

## How it works

When starting the code, you will be greeted with a main menu. You may choose to continue to the generator or type help to see a sentence or two that will hopefully answer whatever questions you may have. Once you continue, you will input the amount of npcs you would like to generate. After that a final statement will be printed with the attributes of all the npcs you asked for. And that's it! 

I hope this explanation helped and answered any questions you may have had. 

Thank you! 
Julian Fechner
